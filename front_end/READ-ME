AUDIO DENVER - 

description - 
Audio Denver allows you to view current concerts that are taking place in Denver.
The app utelizes the StubHub API to fetch all of the concerts, along with their other information.
Each of the concert cards will tell you whether the concert is sold out, has many, or very few tickets left
The name of the concert is clickable and will open a new tab that takes you to the StubHub tickets page

Steps to using this product -
Clone it down from GitHub "https://github.com/gagedoug13/Mod3_Project"
In your terminal, type git clone and paste the cloned link
Bundle install in the terminal
Apply for an API key on https://developer.stubhub.com/products
Once you've received an access token, plug it in as the authorization value in the show.js file on line 68
On line 63, fetch to "https://api.stubhub.com/sellers/search/events/v3" (you can add the parameters you want to fetch after v3)
Run lite-server in your terminal!

Other features I want to implement - 
So something I really wanted to do is show and sort the concerts by closest to furthest from my location.
This specific API doesn't offer lat/lng coordinates, but if it did, I could plug the coordinates into 
the Google Maps Matrix API to show the distance from a given location.
I would also like to make other filter methods to display the concerts in different orders.
